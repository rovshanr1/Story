In the AI war future, her appearance inspires a rogue AI to create a religion around her, with symbols of her Chronosphere etched into skyscrapers.
In the medieval kingdom, her advanced knowledge is mistaken for witchcraft, sparking a revolution.
In the prehistoric era, a simple footprint she leaves behind leads to an evolutionary anomaly in raptors, making them unnervingly intelligent.
Elena’s desperate attempts to repair the Chronosphere attract a mysterious figure: a Temporal Warden. The Warden, clad in shimmering armor that flickers like TV static, is tasked with protecting the integrity of the timeline. The Warden blames Elena for the temporal chaos and vows to erase her from existence to restore balance.

Now, Elena must outwit the Warden while piecing together fragments of her broken device. Each jump brings her closer to understanding the Chronosphere’s malfunction but also deeper into danger. Along the way, she meets allies: a disillusioned AI technician, a medieval blacksmith who dreams of flight, and even a sentient raptor. Together, they uncover the truth: the Chronosphere didn’t malfunction by accident—it was sabotaged by the Warden’s own order, who feared the power of time travel falling into human hands.

In a final, harrowing leap, Elena returns to her original timeline—decades after her departure. The world she finds is unrecognizable, shaped by her unintentional interventions. She faces a choice: fix the timeline by erasing her own existence or embrace the chaos she’s wrought and guide the world into an uncertain future.

As the Chronosphere hums one last time, Elena steps forward, her decision echoing across eternity.
