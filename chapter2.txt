Dr. Elena Moreau, a brilliant physicist, achieves her life’s ambition: creating the world’s first functional time machine. Dubbed the Chronosphere, it operates by opening microscopic wormholes to slip through time. To test her invention, Elena chooses a controlled experiment—a brief trip to 1923 to witness the opening of King Tutankhamun's tomb.

Equipped with a failsafe mechanism to tether her back to the present, Elena activates the Chronosphere. She successfully materializes in the blazing desert, hiding behind dunes as she witnesses history. But as she marvels at the scene, her tether begins to fray. A glitch in the Chronosphere’s calibration causes the wormhole to destabilize, and her failsafe burns out.

Instead of pulling her back to the present, the Chronosphere sends her spiraling uncontrollably through time. She lands in strange, fragmented epochs: a futuristic city consumed by artificial intelligence wars, a medieval kingdom gripped by a deadly plague, and even a prehistoric jungle where towering dinosaurs roam. Each time she lands, she inadvertently alters the timeline—leaving behind ripples of unintended consequences.
